## View the organization

TiDB Cloud provides a hierarchy based on organizations to facilitate the management of your TiDB clusters. In the organization's hierarchy, an organization can contain multiple clusters and users.

Under this structure:

1. Billing happens at the organization level while preserving visibility into usage in each cluster.

2. You can view all users within an organization.

To access one organization or a cluster within this organization, the user must be a member of the organization. Depending on the user's role in the organization, there is only one administrator who is also the creator of the organization. Users can be invited by the administrator to create and manage the clusters in the organization.

To view your organization, perform the following steps:

1. Click the account name on the upper right of the window.

2. Click **Preferences**. The **Organization** tab displays by default.

## Invite a team member

3. Click **User Access**.

4. Click the **+ Invite** icon.

5. Enter the email of the user that you want to invite in the dialog.

6. Click **Confirm**. Then the new user is successfully added into the user list. At the same time, an email is sent to the invited email with a verification link.

7. When the user receives this email, click the link in the email to verify the identity, and a new page displays.

8. On the new page, the user needs to view and agree with our license, and then click **Submit** to create the account in TiDB Cloud. After that, the user is redirected to the login page.
